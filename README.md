When life hands you a vacant lot, make a garden.Â 


Such has been the philosophy of many residents in Philadelphia, a city that, like many in the United States, is home to thousands of properties that have been abandoned by their legal owners. Rather than let them sit idle, enterprising Philadelphians across the city have taken it upon themselves to tend to these lots as their own, converting them into cherished public assets. These properties come in all shapes and sizes, from small side yards to sprawling [community gardens] (https://iglesiasgardens.com/) that span across multiple parcels.


Recently, a threat has emerged that could result in the sale of scores of these vacant properties. Described in greater detail below, thousands are under threat of foreclosure, which would take these properties from the community and place them into the hands of the highest bidder.


In collaboration with Philadelphia Legal Assistance, we are creating a web app to help residents, policymakers, and members of the public to understand the scope of this problem. The app will be designed to accomplish two, principal aims: (1) to visualize and explore the full portfolio of vacant properties in Philadelphia; and (2) to predict and rank which are under the greatest threat of disposition.
