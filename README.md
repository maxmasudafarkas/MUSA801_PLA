# Yes Vacancy: Protecting Vacant Lots in Philadelphia

## Introduction

When life hands you a vacant lot, make a garden. 


Such has been the philosophy of many residents in Philadelphia, a city that, like many in the United States, is home to thousands of properties that lie vacant in neighborhoods from Kensington to West Philadelphia. Rather than let them sit idle, enterprising Philadelphians have taken it upon themselves to tend to these lots as their own, converting them into cherished public assets. These properties come in all shapes and sizes, from small side yards to sprawling [community gardens](https://iglesiasgardens.com/) that span across multiple parcels.


Recently, however, a threat has emerged that could result in the sale of scores of these vacant properties. 


The City of Philadelphia has been foreclosing on vacant properties in bulk to recover delinquent taxes. Following foreclosure, the City will initiate a forced sale through a public auction known as a sheriff's sale, transferring the property to the highest bidder. Neither the original owner nor the neighbors who have cared for the property in the owner's absence can stop such a sale once it's underway.


As if that were not enough, vacant lots in Philadelphia face an additional threat. In the late 1990's, the City of Philadelphia sold over 30,000 tax liens to U.S. Bank, a private financial institution, in an effort to raise funds for public education. (This effort proved largely [unsuccessful](https://controller.phila.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DelinquentRealEstateTaxes_November2013.pdf#page=20).) As a result, today over two thousand vacant lots in Philadelphia are encumbered by liens owned by U.S. Bank, entitling the bank unilaterally to foreclose on those properties, much like the City.


In light of these trends, neighbors and communities are rightly concerned that they may lose properties that, for years, have constructively been theirs. But there is reason for hope. 


A range of legal and policy options may be available to these stakeholders depending on their specific circumstances. Advocacy [efforts](https://www.pubintlaw.org/cases-and-projects/our-testimony-on-us-bank-liens-and-displacement-in-philadelphia/) are currently underway to halt sheriff's sales for certain classes of vacant lots. Some policy solutions already exist, especially for vacant lots that are [City-owned](https://phdcphila.org/land/buy-land/side-or-rear-yards/). In some cases, stakeholders may even have legal rights: Neighbors who have tended to vacant lots adjoining their properties may have a path to ownership through a legal doctrine known as [adverse possession](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/adverse_possession).


A variety of grassroots and legal advocacy organizations have taken up the mantle to explore these options, and more, to ensure that vacant lots remain in the care of the neighbors and communities who have invested in them for years. **In collaboration with Philadelphia Legal Assistance, we are thus creating a web app to help residents, policymakers, and members of the public to understand the scope of this problem. The app will be designed to accomplish two, principal aims: (1) to visualize and explore the full portfolio of vacant properties in Philadelphia; and (2) to predict and rank which are under the greatest threat of development.**
